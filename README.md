For my engineering degree project, I developed a Python-Kivy application designed to run on a Raspberry Pi. The app enables the control of key respiratory settings via a serial connection to an STM microcontroller. It also provides real-time patient monitoring, with all data and system states displayed on a connected responsive monitor. This system effectively combines control and monitoring into a single interface for managing ventilation processes.
